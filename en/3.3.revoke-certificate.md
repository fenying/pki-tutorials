# 3.3. Revoke Certificates

This chapter describes how to revoke certificates using OpenSSL command-line tools.

Revoke certificates is very easy, what you need is the intermediate CA certificate that issued the
certificate (with `cRLSign` usage) and execute the `openssl ca -revoke` subcommand.

## Reason for Revocation

The reason for revocation (`crl_reason`) is required, and here are the choices:

- unspecified
- keyCompromise
- CACompromise
- affiliationChanged
- superseded
- cessationOfOperation
- certificateHold
- removeFromCRL

(to be continued)...
